# Styleguide

My app currently has no unified visual profile, and feels quite prototyped. Visual design is not a subject I'm familiar with. Do you have any ideas how to improve this, primarily from a visual perspective?

I'm thinking with regards to visual profile, primarily. UI interaction element shapes, look and feel of menus and so on. Keeping in mind general UX principles about reasonably good contrast and similar.

Maps are a key feature of the app, primarily centered on forest use. Colors and themes for the app in general might be inspired by the ideas dense forest, sunny but shaded glen, cool shade under the treetops, pleasantly warm summer afternoon. Enough contrast not to feel washed-out. Peaceful but focused in the way that a light jog in a warm forest feels. I don't want the distinction between a light theme and a dark theme; my app will use only one theme.

The specific UI controls used on the orienteering maps need to contrast nicely with the colors generally used in an orienteering map, of course, since the map would be the background. And otherwise not clash too badly with it. But I'm not sure if the orienteering map color palette should be a deliberate focus for the app in general, since those colors are chosen from a very utilitarian perspective. They're not beautiful or peaceful at all, but I want the visual profile for the rest of the app to be.

Maps are the main feature of the app. But there aren't that many interaction controls for the maps; the maps themselves generally stay in focus with only some interaction controls for changing modes, selecting maps or GPS tracks for analysis or interacting with these. 

There's also significant functionality that *doesn't* have maps on them, and it's critical that these pages share the same feel, evoke the same feelings as the themes of the map pages. Your suggestions must be compatible with this.

Some UI elements will be highlighted to indicate "selected" status at various points, some will have colors that say "click here" or "if you click here, dramatic things will happen". Some contain icons.

The deliberables of this discussion are intended to be a minimally comprehensive design document that can be read by our LLM associates implementing this, like a styleguide. Along with an independent, example HTML document with styling, that demonstrates the various styles, colors and visual elements used.

Think a bit about this and see what suggestions you arrive at.
