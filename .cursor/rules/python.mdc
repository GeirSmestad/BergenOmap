# Python Conventions

- Follow existing patterns in `backend/bergenomap/`
- Use the repository pattern for database access
- When modifying the database schema, *write DB interface code that assumes migration scripts have been run*. No defensive code that accepts multiple versions of the schema, unless explicitly prompted.
